# SillyGeo
IP geolocation service implementation. 
It includes implementations for a few IP geo data providers and SQlite-backed service. I also plan to add Redis support as soon as there is a Core 5 version.

There is going to be a small web demo, automatic provider data loaders and a few unicorns.

It targets .NET Core 5.
