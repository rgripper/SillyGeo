IP geolocation service implementation. 
It includes implementations for few IP data providers and Sqlite-backed service. (I may add MSSQL and MongoDB stores in the future)

There is goint to be a tiny demo Web API, automatic provider data loaders and heaps of UNICORNS!!!

It is currently meant to be run on .NET Core 5 (beta :hatching_chick:).
